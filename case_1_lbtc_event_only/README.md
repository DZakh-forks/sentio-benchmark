# Case 1: LBTC Event-Only Indexing Benchmark

This benchmark tests the performance of various indexers when processing simple Transfer events from the LBTC token contract.

## Benchmark Specification

- **Target Contract**: LBTC Token (0x8236a87084f8B84306f72007F36F2618A5634494)
- **Events Indexed**: Transfer events only
- **Block Range**: 0 to 22200000
- **Data Operations**: Write-only (no read-after-write)
- **RPC Calls**: None (data derived directly from event logs)
- **Dataset**: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1D8HXn7U7qQjzaEh1TLUZbNzVW_6nIRpT)

## Implementation Details

The benchmark requires each indexer to:
1. Listen for `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)` events
2. Create a record for each Transfer event with the following fields:
   - ID (unique identifier)
   - From address
   - To address
   - Value transferred
   - Block number
   - Transaction hash

## Performance Results

| Indexer  | Time to Complete | Records Indexed | Notes |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Sentio   | 8m               | 296,734        | |
| Envio    | 2m               | 296,734        | Fastest processing time |
| Ponder   | 1h40m            | 296,138        | Missing ~5% of events |
| Subsquid | 10m              | 296,734        | |
| Subgraph | 3h9m             | 296,734        | |

## Implementation Examples

Each subdirectory contains the implementation for a specific indexing platform:
- `/sentio`: Sentio implementation 
- `/envio`: Envio implementation
- `/ponder`: Ponder implementation
- `/sqd`: Subsquid implementation
- `/subgraph`: The Graph subgraph implementation

## Running the Benchmark

Each implementation includes its own setup and execution instructions. Generally, you will need to:

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Configure RPC endpoints
3. Start the indexer
4. Monitor progress
5. Record completion time

## Key Observations

- Envio demonstrates the fastest processing time for this simple event indexing scenario
- Ponder processes events significantly slower and misses approximately 5% of the data
- Sentio and Subsquid offer good balance of speed and completeness
- Subgraph requires significantly more time to complete the indexing

This benchmark showcases performance differences when handling straightforward event-only indexing, which is a common use case for blockchain data indexing.
