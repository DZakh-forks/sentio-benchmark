## Test Methodology

### Test Configuration
- All benchmarks run on standardized hardware environments
- Each test runs until completion or timeout (72 hours)
- RPC providers: When built-in RPC support isn't available, we use Alchemy Growth tier

### Test Case Design
Our benchmark cases are designed to test different aspects of indexer performance:

1. **Chain Selection**: 
   - Ethereum Mainnet for all test cases

2. **Data Types**:
   - Events: Transfer events in case_1 and case_2
   - Blocks: Block data in case_3
   - Transactions: Gas usage in case_4
   - Traces: Uniswap V2 swap transactions in case_5

3. **RPC Patterns**:
   - No RPC: case_1 tests raw event processing
   - RPC Calls: case_2 tests balanceOf() calls
   - Block Data: case_3 tests block processing
   - Transaction Data: case_4 tests transaction processing
   - Trace Data: case_5 tests transaction trace processing

4. **Write Patterns**:
   - Write-only: case_1 tests simple data storage
   - Read-after-write: case_2 tests database interaction complexity
   - Computational: case_4 tests calculation and derivation of metrics

\* Envio's HyperSync technology offers up to 2000x faster data access compared to traditional RPC methods  
$ Envio does not support natively, but one can utilize HyperSync to retrieve data  
† Subgraph has limited internal transaction visibility, only detecting direct contract calls, not internal transactions. This leads to incomplete data (~40% fewer records) and inaccurate sender identification in trace-level indexing as documented in the [case_5_on_trace](./case_5_on_trace/) benchmark.

⚠️ Limited capability or requires additional configuration

This benchmark provides a comparative analysis of indexer performance across different scenarios, helping developers choose the most appropriate indexing solution for their specific needs.

\* Missing ~5% of events  
‡   Some implementations include 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address  
†   Missing 86,844 blocks (86.84% of target range)  
¶   Some implementations count 100,001 blocks because they include block 0 in their range  
††  Envio processes blocks 22,280,000 to 22,289,999 due to exclusive end block handling, resulting in 218 fewer transactions  
&   Subgraph does not support transaction level access  
¶¶  Sentio auto-filters failed calls due to insufficient fees  
**  Ponder documentation indicates trace support, but our implementation encountered configuration issues that prevented successful trace capture  
§§  Subgraph captured only ~58% of swap traces due to architectural limitations in accessing internal transactions  
††† Subsquid captured 1,067 fewer swaps than other platforms  

### Key Observations

1. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Envio and Sentio show the fastest indexing times across most test cases
   - Envio's HyperSync technology demonstrates exceptional performance for block and transaction indexing
   - Ponder shows longer indexing times but with complete data coverage in most cases
   - Subgraph demonstrates efficient block processing (10m for 100K blocks) with complete coverage

2. **Data Completeness**:
   - Ponder is missing approximately 5% of data in case_1
   - Subsquid is missing about 87% of blocks in case_3, primarily indexing blocks in the 45,000-100,000 range
   - Envio/Ponder processes blocks up to but not including the end block in case_4 (stopping at 22,289,999) due to its exclusive end block handling, which explains the difference of 218 records compared to Sentio
   - Sentio processed fewer traces in case_5 (45,895 vs 50,191 for Subsquid/Envio), possibly due to failed trace calls resulting from insufficient fees (requires further investigation to achieve complete data matching between implementations)
   - Subgraph captured only ~58% of swap transactions in case_5 and identified significantly fewer unique senders (427 vs. ~1,200) due to limitations in accessing internal transactions
   - Case 3 shows perfect data consistency with 100% similarity for blocks across all platforms

3. **Specialized Capabilities**:
   - Envio shows exceptional performance with HyperSync technology (7.9s for 100K blocks, 30.75s for 90K blocks with trace data)
   - Sentio performs consistently well across all test cases
   - Subsquid shows fast processing but significant data gaps in block-level indexing
   - Subgraph has fundamental architectural limitations for trace-level indexing, including inability to access internal transactions and inaccurate sender identification

4. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Event processing (case_1) is efficient across all indexers
   - Block-level indexing (case_3) shows dramatic performance differences between traditional approaches and Envio's HyperSync
   - RPC calls and complex data handling (case_2) increase indexing time for all indexers
   - Trace processing (case_5) demonstrates the efficiency of specialized data access methods, with Envio's HyperSync showing exceptional performance
   - While Ponder officially supports trace-level indexing, our implementation encountered persistent issues with capturing trace data despite multiple configuration attempts
