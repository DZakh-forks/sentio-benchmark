## Test Methodology

### Test Configuration
- All benchmarks run on standardized hardware environments
- Each test runs until completion or timeout (72 hours)
- RPC providers: When built-in RPC support isn't available, we use Alchemy Growth tier

### Test Case Design
Our benchmark cases are designed to test different aspects of indexer performance:

1. **Chain Selection**: 
   - Ethereum Mainnet for all test cases

2. **Data Types**:
   - Events: Transfer events in case_1 and case_2
   - Blocks: Block data in case_3
   - Transactions: Gas usage in case_4
   - Traces: Uniswap V2 swap transactions in case_5

3. **RPC Patterns**:
   - No RPC: case_1 tests raw event processing
   - RPC Calls: case_2 tests balanceOf() calls
   - Block Data: case_3 tests block processing
   - Transaction Data: case_4 tests transaction processing
   - Trace Data: case_5 tests transaction trace processing
   - Template Data: case_6 tests factory contract event processing and pair creation tracking

4. **Write Patterns**:
   - Write-only: case_1 tests simple data storage
   - Read-after-write: case_2 tests database interaction complexity
   - Computational: case_2/case_4 tests calculation and derivation of metrics

## Indexer Platforms

### Platform Descriptions

- **Sentio**: The most comprehensive blockchain data platform with the widest chain support, offering both raw data access and indexing capabilities across multiple blockchain ecosystems
- **Envio HyperSync**: Envio's high-performance EVM based blockchain data engine that serves as a direct replacement for traditional RPC endpoints for raw blockchain data
- **Envio HyperIndex**: Built on top of HyperSync, providing a complete indexing framework with schema management, event handling, and GraphQL APIs

⚠️ Limited capability or requires additional configuration

$ Envio does not support natively, but one can utilize HyperSync to retrieve data, but it requires manual decoding and client-side processing of reorgs.

$$ Subsquid does have access internal call trace as bytes, however, it requires manual decoding

† Subgraph has limited internal transaction visibility, only detecting direct contract calls, not internal transactions. This leads to incomplete data (~40% fewer records) and inaccurate sender identification in trace-level indexing as documented in the [case_5_on_trace](./case_5_on_trace/) benchmark.

\* Subsquid requires manual configuration updates at fixed blocks to optimize template indexing, with limitations on the number of contracts (up to tens of thousands) and requiring periodic maintenance to minimize sync overhead.

^ Rely on multicall contract deployed by MakerDAO for batch RPC calls, with Envio using built-in platform infrastructure and others using multicall

This benchmark provides a comparative analysis of indexer performance across different scenarios, helping developers choose the most appropriate indexing solution for their specific needs.

   - Ponder is missing approximately 5% of data in case_1
   - Subsquid is missing about 87% of blocks in case_3, primarily indexing blocks in the 45,000-100,000 range
   - Envio/Ponder processes blocks up to but not including the end block in case_4 (stopping at 22,289,999) due to its exclusive end block handling

   - Sentio performs consistently well across all test cases
   - Subsquid shows fast processing but significant data gaps in block-level indexing
   - Subgraph has fundamental architectural limitations for trace-level indexing, including inability to access internal transactions and inaccurate sender identification

   - Event processing (case_1) is efficient across all indexers
   - Block-level indexing (case_3) shows dramatic performance differences between traditional approaches and Envio's HyperSync
   - RPC calls and complex data handling (case_2) increase indexing time for all indexers
   - Trace processing (case_5) demonstrates the efficiency of specialized data access methods, with Envio's HyperSync showing exceptional performance
