## Performance Results

| Indexer  | Processing Time | Records | Block Range | 
|----------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Sentio   | 23m            | 1,696,641 | 22,280,000-22,290,000 |
| Subsquid | 5m             | 1,696,641 | 22,280,000-22,290,000 |
| Envio    | 1m 26s         | 1,696,423 | 22,280,000-22,289,999 |
| Ponder   | 33m            | 1,696,423 | 22,280,000-22,289,999 |
| Subgraph | N/A            | N/A       | N/A                   | 

## Data Distribution Details

The distribution of transactions across platforms is remarkably consistent, with approximately 170 transactions per block on average:

- **Sentio**: 1,696,641 transaction records
- **Subsquid**: 1,696,641 transaction records
- **Envio**: 1,696,423 transaction records
  - Unique senders: 493,181
  - Unique recipients: 315,861
  - Total gas value: 10,161,297,133,770,000,000,000 wei
  - Average gas value per transaction: 5,989,836,929,686,758 wei (~0.00599 ETH)
- **Ponder**: 1,696,423 transaction records
  - Average processing time per block event: 33.057ms
- **Subgraph**: Not supported (The Graph does not support transaction handlers)

## Key Findings

1. **Complete Data Coverage**: Sentio, Subsquid, Envio, and Ponder all demonstrated high coverage of the transaction data in the target block range, with some variations in the total record count due to differences in how platforms handle block boundaries:
   - **End Block Handling**: Analysis reveals that Envio/Ponder process blocks up to but not including the end block (exclusive handling), stopping at block 22,289,999 in practice, while Sentio/Subsquid include the end block (inclusive handling), going all the way to block 22,290,000. This accounts for the 218 additional records in Sentio's dataset.

2. **Performance Differences**:
   - **Envio with HyperSync** demonstrated exceptional performance at 1 minute 26 seconds, processing transactions at a rate of approximately 20,000 transactions per second.
   - **Subsquid** showed excellent performance at 5 minutes, making it the fastest among the traditional indexers.
   - **Sentio** completed in 23 minutes with reliable performance.
   - **Ponder** processed all transactions in 33 minutes.

3. **Implementation Approaches**:
   - Envio's implementation leverages their HyperSync technology for optimized blockchain data access.
   - Traditional indexers process transactions through block-by-block handlers with RPC calls.

## Implementation Details

Each subdirectory contains the implementation for a specific indexing platform:
- `/sentio`: Sentio implementation 
- `/envio`: Envio implementation with HyperSync
- `/ponder`: Ponder implementation
- `/sqd`: Subsquid implementation

## Platform Notes

### Sentio
- Complete coverage of all transactions
- Processing time: 23 minutes (18:26:14 - 18:49:39)
- Total transaction records: 1,696,641
- Processes blocks up to and including block 22,290,000 (inclusive end block handling)

### Subsquid
- Complete coverage of all transactions
- Processing time: 5 minutes (18:47:50 - 18:52:17)
- Total transaction records: ~1,700,000

### Envio
- Uses HyperSync technology for optimized data access
- Processing time: 1 minute 26 seconds (85.59s)
- Total transaction records: 1,696,423
- Processed 9,901 blocks with ~170 transactions per block
- Processes blocks up to but not including the end block (stopping at 22,289,999)
- The block range handling explains the difference of 218 records compared to Sentio

### Ponder
- Complete coverage of all transactions
- Processing time: 33 minutes
- Total transaction records: 1,696,423
- Average processing time per block event: 33.057ms
- Processes blocks up to 22,289,999

### Subgraph
- Does not support transaction handlers
- No implementation for this benchmark case

## Conclusion

This benchmark demonstrates significant performance differences in transaction data processing across indexing platforms. Envio's HyperSync technology demonstrates exceptional speed, followed by Subsquid's efficient processing. All platforms show impressive consistency in the data captured, with minimal variations in transaction counts that can be explained by differences in how the platforms handle block range boundaries (inclusive vs. exclusive end block handling).

These results highlight the importance of choosing the right indexing solution based on specific use cases, especially for applications requiring transaction-level analysis such as gas usage tracking, fee market analysis, or transaction monitoring.
